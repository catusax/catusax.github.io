## 题目

> For this part, you are allowed 30 minutes to write an essay. Suppose you have two options upon graduation: one is to find a job somewhere and the other to start a business of your own.<!--more--> You are to make a decision. Write an essay to explain the reasons for your decision. You should write at least 120 words but no more than 180 words.

## 答

As a hath，my decision is to find a job somewhere.

There are three reasons for this:

Firstly,we are just graduated.We are too young,too simple,sometimes naive.Doing business is risky for us.

What's more,a businessman is busy,so he has no time to do something else.But if we chose to find a job,we may have more time which can be added to the elder.

Last but not least,in 2009,the elder said:"The hath shall not do business."So,as a hath,we should never against the elder's will.

Finally,please allow me to conclude with a sentence from Donald Trump--the most famous hath in the world:

> I’m not a politician, and have never wanted to be one.But when I saw the trouble our country was in, I knew I couldn’t stand by and watch any longer.
